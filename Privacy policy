Sticky Notes Privacy Policy

Last Updated: April 08, 2025

Sticky Notes is a Chrome extension developed by Ben Steele. I value your privacy and collect minimal data to provide note-taking functionality.

Data Collected:
- Website hostnames (e.g., "example.com") to associate notes with sites.
- User-entered notes stored via chrome.storage.sync.

Data Usage:
- Data is used solely to enable site-specific note-taking and syncing across devices if Chrome Sync is enabled.
- We do not sell, share, or transfer your data to third parties, except as part of Chrome Sync’s approved use case.
- No data is used for unrelated purposes, creditworthiness, or lending.

Permissions:
- "storage": To save and retrieve notes.
- "activeTab": To identify the current website’s hostname.


This policy may be updated; check the Chrome Web Store listing for the latest version.
